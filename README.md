# Randomly Exploring Random Tree Path Planner ROS Plugin
This plugin implements a simulated Randomly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) path planner for the Kinetic Kame release of the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework. It uses the nav_core::BaseGlobalPlanner interface and can be used on any platforms that implement the move_base package, but has been specifically tested using the simulated Turtlebot platform.
