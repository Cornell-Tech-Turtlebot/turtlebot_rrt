 * @brief Algorithm to make the turtlebot move around a gazebo workspace
 * @detail The turtlebot will move forward in a straight line until
 * encountering an obstacle. The turtlebot will then rotate until a clear
 * path is available and again drive forward. Rinse and repeat until you
 * get bored of watching.
